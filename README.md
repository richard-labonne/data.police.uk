This is a Python script to programmatically interface with the Police UK open data API (https://data.police.uk/docs/). Location IDs are configurable and selected crime data is retrived for the year to date. 

This script can be easily adapted to interface with other UK Govt. open data APIs (https://www.api.gov.uk/#uk-public-sector-apis)
